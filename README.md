# LangChain Chatbot Template 🤖📚

This project is a flexible template for building conversational AI using [LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) and OpenAI. It includes two main chatbot modes:

- `starter.py`: A simple memory-powered chatbot using OpenAI GPT.
- `chat_with_pdf.py`: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that can read and answer questions from a large PDF (e.g., 1400+ pages).
